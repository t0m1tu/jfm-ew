\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:headings}

In dielectrowetting research, the effect of non-uniform electric fields on liquid wetting has been established. \cite{mchale_dielectrowetting_2011}, for instance, demonstrated that tailored non-uniform fields enable control of the contact angle and wetting state.

The dynamics of droplet impact on solid surfaces is a classical problem in fluid mechanics, with various engineering applications, including inkjet printing, spray cooling, and microfluidic actuation. The interaction between inertia, surface tension, viscosity, and wettability gives rise to complex behaviors, such as spreading, retraction, rebound, or splashing. In recent years, the ability to actively modulate wettability through external stimuli has attracted significant interest, particularly via electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). In EWOD systems, the apparent contact angle of a droplet can be dynamically controlled by applying an electric potential across a dielectric-coated electrode, enabling real-time tuning of droplet behavior. 

Previous studies have extensively investigated the role of electrowetting in modifying contact angle hysteresis, controlling spreading dynamics, and suppressing rebound. Most of these works, however, assume that the applied electric field is spatially uniform. In practical implementations--especially when thin electrodes with finite conductivity or localized voltage sources are employed--the electric potential may decay laterally along the substrate. This non-uniformity can lead to spatial gradients in wettability and contact angle, potentially altering the droplet impact regimes. Despite its physical relevance, the influence of electric potential decay on droplet dynamics has received little attention and remains poorly understood.

In this work, we study the impact of a millimetric water droplet on a hydrophobic substrate subject to a laterally decaying electric potential of the form $\phi(r) = \phi_0 e^{-\alpha r}$, where $\alpha$ is the electric potential decay constant. Using a dimensionless formulation, we investigate how this spatial variation in potential affects the contact angle distribution, impact-induced deformation, and rebound behavior. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include time-harmonic potentials to examine the frequency-dependent response of the droplet under alternating fields. A combination of numerical simulation and phase-space classification is employed to delineate different behavioral regimes.

The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:Problem and method} introduces the problem formulation and numerical methods. Section~\ref{sec:Results} presents a phase diagram and classification of electrowetting-induced wettability. The influence of electric potential decay on droplet dynamics is then examined, followed by an analysis of the frequency-dependent response of droplet behavior under time-varying electric potentials. Conclusions are drawn in Section~\ref{sec:Conclusion}.

\section{Problem and method}\label{sec:Problem and method}

\subsection{Governing equations and numerics models}

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/model.eps}}
  \caption{Schematic of the physical model and governing parameters. A liquid droplet of radius $R$, density $\rho_{l}$ and viscosity $\mu_{l}$ impacts a hydrophobic substrate with initial velocity $U_{0}$ under gravity $g$. The surrounding gas has density $\rho_{g}$ and viscosity $\mu_{g}$. The liquid-gas interface is characterized by surface tension $\gamma$. The substrate is subject to electrowetting, with the apparent contact angle $\theta$ modified by an electric potential that decays along the substrate as $\phi e^{-\alpha x}$. The coordinate system is defined by the radial direction $r$ and vertical direction $z$.}
 \label{fig:domain}
 \end{figure}

Consider a water droplet of diameter $D$ placed upon the substrate exhibiting electric potential decay $\phi_0 e^{-\alpha r}$, where $\alpha$ is the electric potential decay constant. The droplet impacts the electrowetting surface with the velocity $U_0$. The density and viscosity are denoted by $\rho$ and $\mu$, with subscripts $l$ and $g$ indicating the liquid and the surrounding gas. In the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) phenomena under consideration, the wettability of substrate is varied by applied electric current. The variation of contact angle which is inducted by electrowetting can be described by the Young-Lippmann equation

\begin{equation}
	\cos(\theta_{\mathrm{ew}}) = \cos\theta_{\mathrm{s}} + \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}{2 \gamma d} \phi^2 .
  \label{Young-Lippmann equation}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\theta_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the static contact angle, $\theta_{\mathrm{ew}}$ is the electrowetting induced contact angle, and $\gamma$ is the surface tension. $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum's permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ and $d$ is the dielectric constant and dielectric thickness. Due to the electric potential decay, the contact angle at the wall exhibits a trend of being lower at the center and higher at the periphery. Figure \ref{fig:domain} shows the configuration of the water droplet in the domain for computations. 

The water droplet and surrounding fluid are controlled by the continuity and momentum equations for the incompressible fluids

\begin{equation}
  \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
  \label{continuity equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \rho(\partial_t \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})=-\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \mu (\nabla\mathbf{u}+\nabla^T\mathbf{u}) + \gamma \kappa \delta_s \mathbf{n} + \rho \mathbf{g} ,
  \label{momentum equation}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravity acceleration. A volume fraction function, denoted by $c$, is introduced to distinguish between the two immiscible fluid phases in the computational domain. Specifically, $c = 1$ corresponds to the liquid phase (water), and $c = 0$ corresponds to the gas phase (air). This function is constructed based on the known location of the interface. Since the density $\rho$ and viscosity $\mu$ are constant within each phase, their spatial distributions across the domain can be conveniently expressed in terms of $c$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \rho &= \rho_{g} + (\rho_{l} - \rho_{g})c, \\
  \mu  &= \mu_{g} + (\mu_{l} - \mu_{g})c,
  \end{aligned}
  \label{volume fraction function}
\end{equation}

\noindent where subscripts $l$ and $g$ denote the liquid and gas phases, respectively. The function $c$ thus implicitly tracks the interface and evolves in time according to the following advection equation:

\begin{equation}
  \partial_t c + \nabla \cdot (c \boldsymbol{u}) = 0,
  \label{advection equation}
\end{equation}

\noindent We nondimensionalize all variables using the diameter of the drop $D$. Therefore, the timescale is $\tau=\sqrt{\rho_l D^3 / \gamma}$, the velocity scale is $\sqrt{\gamma/\rho_l D}$, and the length scale is $D$. The three nondimensional parameters, the Ohnesorge number, the Weber number, the Bond number:

\begin{equation}
  Oh = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\rho \gamma D}}, We = \frac{\rho D U_0}{\gamma}, Bo = \frac{\rho g D^2}{\gamma} .
  \label{advection equation}
\end{equation}


\noindent We consider the effect of gravity by setting $Bo$ as a constant in all cases. And all the material properties the density ratio $\rho_g/\rho_l$, the viscosity ratio $\mu_g/\mu_l$ are typically defined as constants $1 \times 10^{-3}$ and $1.79 \times 10^{-2}$. Here, a Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method of combining an adaptive quad spatial discretisation \citep{popinet_gerris_2003, popinet_accurate_2009,afkhami_mesh-dependent_2009,afkhami_transition_2018} is chosen to implement the electrowetting technique with dynamic contact angle model. 


When a sessile droplet equilibrium on the substreate, the static contact angle $\theta_s$ is the angle between the interface of droplet and the substrate surface. The dynamic contact angle $\theta_{\mathrm{D}}$ is implemented using the molecular kinetic theory (MKT) \citep{duvivier_toward_2013,cheng_numerical_2018,kumar_droplet_2024}. Using the theory, the dynamic contact angle $\theta_D$ and contact line velocity $v_{\mathrm{cl}}$ have the following relationship:

\begin{equation}
  v_{\mathrm{cl}} = 2 k_s^0 l \left (  \frac{h}{\mu V_m} \right ) \sinh{\left[ \frac{\gamma}{2 n k_B T} (\cos{\theta_{\mathrm{s}}} - \cos{\theta_D}) \right]}.
  \label{contact line velocity equation}
\end{equation}

  \label{tab:parameters}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


\noindent The values of all reference parameters employed in the present study are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. The contact line velocity is limited by the maximum for the dynamic contact angle of $180^\circ$ and the minimum for the dynamic contact angle of $0^\circ$:

\begin{equation}
  v_{\mathrm{cl} 180^\circ} = 2 k_s^0 l \left (  \frac{h}{\mu V_m} \right ) \sinh{\left[ \frac{\gamma}{2 n k_B T} (\cos{\theta_{\mathrm{s}}} + 1) \right]},
  \label{contact line velocity upper}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  - v_{\mathrm{cl} 0^\circ} = 2 k_s^0 l \left (  \frac{h}{\mu V_m} \right ) \sinh{\left[ \frac{\gamma}{2 n k_B T} ( 1 - \cos{\theta_{\mathrm{s}}} ) \right]}.
  \label{contact line velocity lower}
\end{equation}


\noindent Although the contact line velocity $v_{\mathrm{cl}}$, can theoretically exceed both upper and lower limit, the numerical simulations are constrained to operate within the limits specified by Eqs.~\ref{contact line velocity upper} and \ref{contact line velocity lower}. Under reference conditions, the dynamic contact angle (DCA) is inferred from the prescribed contact line velocity by inverting the corresponding relation. The expression used to compute the DCA is given by

\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\mathrm{D}} = \cos^{-1} \left[ \cos \theta_{\mathrm{s}} - \left( \frac{2n k_B T}{\gamma} \sinh^{-1} \left( \frac{v_{\mathrm{cl}} \mu V_m}{2k_s^0 l h} \right) \right) \right].
  \label{dynamic contact angle}
\end{equation}


Electrowetting technique enables dynamic control of surface wettability by applying an electric potential across a conductive droplet. When the electric potential is established between the droplet and an underlying electrode, charges accumulate at the three-phase contact line. This localized buildup of electric charge leads to a reduction in the interfacial energy between the droplet and the substrate. The extent of contact angle modulation depends on the properties of the liquid, the characteristics of the substrate, and the parameters of the applied electric field in Eqs.~\ref{Young-Lippmann equation}. Accordingly, the relationship between the dynamic contact angle induced by electrowetting and contact line velocity is described by:

\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\mathrm{ED}} = \cos^{-1} \left[ \cos\theta_{\mathrm{s}} + \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}{2 \gamma d} \phi^2 - \left( \frac{2n k_B T}{\gamma} \sinh^{-1} \left( \frac{v_{\mathrm{cl}} \mu V_m}{2k_s^0 l h} \right) \right) \right].
  \label{dynamic contact angle induced by electrowetting}
\end{equation}




\subsection{Problem setup and numerics validation}

 As shown in figure~\ref{fig:domain}, a spherical water droplet of diameter $D$ is initially positioned in close proximity to the lower boundary, which consists of a solid substrate subject to an applied electric potential. The droplet impacts the surface with a prescribed velocity $U_0$, and the dynamics are governed by the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) mechanism. Initially, the contact angle is static, with $\theta_{\mathrm{s}} = 90^\circ$. Upon actuation, the contact angle varies dynamically in response to the applied voltage, which is both spatially and temporally dependent. The applied voltage is defined as

\begin{equation}
  \phi(r,t) = \phi_0 \cos(2\pi f t) \cdot \mathrm{e}^{- \alpha r},
  \label{dynamic electric potential}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi_0$ is the peak amplitude of electric potential, $f$ is the oscillation frequency, and $\alpha$ characterizes the radial decay of the electric potential, accounting for the influence of a uniform resistance on the potential distribution along the dielectric layer. The computational domain is taken as $10D \times 10D$ to ensure sufficient space for droplet deformation and spreading during impact and subsequent evolution. The bottom of the computational domain ($z = 0$) is a no-slip boundary condition, and the left ($r = 0$) is an axisymmetric boundary condition. All remaining boundaries of the computational domain are open boundary conditions.

Building upon earlier incompressible flow theories \citep{smith_air_2003, korobkin_trapping_2008}, \citet{mandre_precursors_2009} derived a criterion to assess the relevance of gas compressibility during high-velocity droplet impacts. Specifically, they introduced a non-dimensional compressibility parameter defined as the ratio between the ambient atmospheric pressure and a characteristic lubrication pressure in the gas layer:

\begin{equation}
  \epsilon = \frac{P_{\mathrm{atm}}}{\left(0.5 * D U_0^7 \rho_l^4 / \mu_g \right)^{1/3}},
  \label{compressibility equation}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $P_{\mathrm{atm}}$ is the ambient atmospheric pressure, and $\mu_g$ the gas viscosity. According to their analysis, gas compressibility becomes significant when $\epsilon^{-1} \gtrsim 3$. In light of this criterion, and supported by the conclusions of \citet{li_time-resolved_2015} and \citet{mandre_precursors_2009}, we neglect gas compressibility effects in the present study. The estimated range of the inverse compressibility parameter in our simulations is $\epsilon^{-1} \approx 0.1 \text{--} 2.0$, which remains well below the threshold for compressibility to play an important role. These values differ slightly from those in earlier studies due to variations in Ohnesorge ($Oh$) and Weber ($We$) numbers, but they still justify the assumption of incompressibility for the gas phase under the current impact conditions.

  \caption{Comparison of drop spreading radius during impact process obtained from experiment data reported by \cite{sikalo_analysis_2002}.}
 \label{fig:verity}
 \end{figure}


To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the numerical model, simulation results are validated against experimental data reported by \citet{sikalo_analysis_2002}. Figure~\ref{fig:verity} presents the time evolution of the spreading radius of the droplet, normalized by its initial radius, as a function of the non-dimensional time. All physical parameters used in the simulation are consistent with those in the referenced experiment. In particular, the Weber number is $We = 44$, and the static contact angle is set to $100^\circ$, matching the experimental configuration. The simulation results exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental data, thereby demonstrating the validity of the computational model in capturing the essential physics of droplet impact and spreading dynamics.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/mesh.pdf}}
  \caption{Verification of grid independence for the droplet spreading radius during impact, based on simulations performed at $\mathit{We}=20$.}
 \label{fig:mesh}
 \end{figure}

For grid independence, we compare the spreading radius with time obtained from simulations, using different grid resolutions to assess the effect of varying grid sizes on the simulation accuracy. Figure \ref{fig:mesh} shows the finest grid sizes from low to high are $\Delta/D = 4.8 \times 10^{-3}$, $\Delta/D = 2.4 \times 10^{-3}$, and $\Delta/D = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ for the given computational domain. The orange dash line is the finest grid level $12$, the red line is the finest grid level $13$ and the blue dash line is the finest grid $14$. Despite these minor differences in the three levels, we notice that the middle grid size level reach the results are not significantly influenced by the grid resolution, while also accounting for the prohibitive computational costs involved. Thus, we choose the middle grid size level for all of our simulations.

\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

In order to compare the dynamics of droplet motion, we first deployed droplets to impact on substrates with the same initial static contact angle, $\theta_{\mathrm{s}} = 90^\circ$. The motion of the droplets can be divided into three stages: spreading, retracting, and rebounding, after which they detach from the substrate. To actively control the contact angle during these dynamics, a voltage is applied between the conducting droplet and an underlying insulated electrode. This configuration, typical of the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) setup, consists of a hydrophobic dielectric layer that electrically isolates the droplet from the conductive substrate. When the electric field is activated, charges accumulate on the droplet side of the dielectric layer, forming a capacitor-like structure. This localized charge distribution results in a reduction of the interfacial energy near the contact line, thereby decreasing the apparent contact angle $\theta_{\mathrm{ED}}$ of the droplet. The variation of the contact angle $\theta_{\mathrm{ED}}$ with applied voltage is governed by the Young-Lippmann equation. To investigate the role of electric potential decay in electrowetting-induced wettability changes, we conduct droplet impact experiments at fixed dimensionless parameters, $Oh = 2.621 \times 10^{-3}$ and $Bo = 0.536$.

\subsection{Phase Diagram and Classification of Electrowetting-Induced Wettability}

When droplet impact the substrate with different electrowetting-induced wettability, it exhibits distinct dynamic reaction owing to voltage-induced variations in the equilibrium contact angle. Since the contact angle governs the balance of interfacial forces, the difference in wettability significantly influences the spreading, retraction, and rebound behaviour of the droplet. On a substrate with an equilibrium contact angle of $90^\circ$, the droplet follows the classical sequence of spreading, receding, and rebounding. At low impact velocities (i.e., low Weber numbers), the droplet may remain entirely separated from the substrate by a thin air layer, resulting in non-contact bouncing. At sufficiently high Weber numbers, the droplet undergoes splashing, with the emission of secondary droplets. To systematically characterise the influence of electrowetting, we construct a phase diagram in the applied voltage-Weber number plane that delineates the regimes of droplet impact behaviour under varying wettability conditions. Figure \ref{fig:phase} delineates the behavioural phase diagram of droplet impact regimes across applied voltages and Weber numbers, encompassing low-velocity complete rebound and cavity-induced jetting, alongside moderate-to-high-velocity partial rebound, deposition, and columnar liquid jetting regimes.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/phase.pdf}}
  \caption{Phase diagrams of the motion state of a droplet impacting with the applied voltage varies obtained from simulations. Open-circle markers denote the selected cases corresponding to each regime.}
 \label{fig:phase}
 \end{figure}

 Figure \ref{fig:dropA} presents a morphological chronology of droplet evolution across distinct regimes, capturing the complete progression from initial contact to final configuration. Sequentially arranged are: columnar jetting, partial rebound, deposition, cavity-induced breakup, and complete rebound -- corresponding to the cases of the phase diagram's open-circle markers. Key features include central jet ejection (columnar jetting), necking phenomena (partial rebound), and filamentous jets (cavity regime/breakup), while deposition and complete rebound are distinguished by their final equilibrium states.


 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{fig/dropA.pdf}}
  \caption{Phase diagrams of the motion state of a droplet impacting with the applied voltage varies obtained from simulations.}
 \label{fig:dropA}
 \end{figure}
 
 When a droplet impacts a solid wall at relatively high velocity, it typically exhibits splashing. For low-viscosity droplets, however, splashing behaviour is normally suppressed \citep{jian_two_2018}. Upon contacting the substrate, the droplet's kinetic energy is rapidly converted into surface energy, driving the spreading until the maximum radius is reached. Subsequently, under the influence of significant surface energy potential, the droplet retracts rapidly. The radially inward convergence of capillary waves from the spreading periphery focuses at the axisymmetric centre, resulting in the formation of a vertical columnar jet. Figure \ref{fig:cojet} shows the droplet impacting sequence, tracing the droplet from spreading through retraction to capillary wave focusing and vertical liquid jet formation. Conversely, at low Weber numbers, the cavity-jet/breakup regime is observed. In this regime, the air film beneath the droplet remains intact throughout the spreading process. And the convergence of slowly propagating capillary waves during spreading forms a central cavity. Subsequent accelerated retraction causes cavity collapse, inducing high-velocity jet ejection. This process typically results in prompt and extensive fragmentation due to vapour cavity implosion. Figure \ref{fig:cajet} illustrates the complete evolution of central cavity formation through collapse-induced jetting. The implosion-driven jets exhibit elevated pressures, resulting in ejected microdroplets with enhanced velocities and reduced diameters.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{fig/cojet.pdf}}
  \caption{The formation process of columnar jet droplets. The left snapshots show the magnitude of the velocity field normalized by the initial impact velocity, and the left snapshots show the dimensionless pressure. The black arrow is the velocity vector of flow. The blue line represents the interface between the droplet and the surrounding gas.}
 \label{fig:cojet}
 \end{figure}

 \label{fig:cajet}
 \end{figure}

 Within the moderate impact velocity regime, droplets typically achieve extensive spreading radii. Owing to substantial surface energy storage, accelerated retraction imparts sufficient kinetic energy to induce necking phenomena, ultimately enabling rebound detachment (partial rebound). In contrast, during deposition events, droplets possess insufficient kinetic energy upon impact. Significant viscous dissipation during spreading depletes momentum reserves, precluding rebound. Consequently, residual energy is exhausted through damped capillary-inertial oscillations until complete immobilisation (deposition). 


%  To elucidate more clearly the evolution of energy between the two regimes, we present the temporal variation of the droplet's energy.

% \begin{equation}
%   E_\mathrm{{total} } = E_\mathrm{k} + E_\mathrm{\gamma} + E_\mathrm{e} + E_\mathrm{g} - E_\mathrm{d}.
%   \label{energy equation}
% \end{equation}


%  The energy balance during droplet impact fundamentally involves kinetic energy $ E_\mathrm{k} $, interfacial energy $ E_\mathrm{\gamma} $, and viscous dissipation $E_\mathrm{d}$ (gravitational potential energy $ E_\mathrm{g} $ being negligible). Within electrowetting frameworks, the imposed electrical energy can usually be expressed as $ E_\mathrm{e} = A_\mathrm{SL} \cdot \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \phi^2  / (2d) $. And the interfacial energy is 

% \begin{equation}
%    E_\mathrm{\gamma} = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} A_\mathrm{LG} + \gamma_\mathrm{SL} A_\mathrm{SL} + \gamma_\mathrm{SG} A_\mathrm{SG} = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} A_\mathrm{LG} + ( \gamma_\mathrm{SL} - \gamma_\mathrm{SG} ) A_\mathrm{SL} + \gamma_\mathrm{SG} A_\mathrm{S} .
%   % = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} A_\mathrm{LG} + \gamma_\mathrm{SL}(V) A_\mathrm{SL} + \gamma_\mathrm{SG} (A_\mathrm{S} - A_\mathrm{SL}) \\
%   \label{surface energy equation}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent Considering $\gamma_\mathrm{SG} A_\mathrm{S}$ as the reference surface energy constant, the Young Laplace equation $\gamma_\mathrm{LG} \cos(\theta_{\mathrm{s}}) = \gamma_\mathrm{SG} - \gamma_\mathrm{SL} $ is substituted into Equation~\ref{surface energy equation} to simplify and yield:

% \begin{equation}
%    \Delta E_\mathrm{\gamma} = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} ( A_\mathrm{LG} - A_\mathrm{SL} \cos(\theta_{\mathrm{s}}) ) .
%   \label{surface energy short equation}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent Equation~\ref{Young-Lippmann equation}

% \begin{equation}
%    \Delta E_\mathrm{\gamma} = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} ( A_\mathrm{LG} - A_\mathrm{SL} \cos\theta_{\mathrm{ew}} + A_\mathrm{SL} \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}{2 \gamma_\mathrm{LG} d} \phi^2  ) = \gamma_\mathrm{LG} ( A_\mathrm{LG} - A_\mathrm{SL} \cos\theta_{\mathrm{ew}} ) + E_\mathrm{e}.
%   \label{surface energy short equation}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent After considering the surface energy as the change in the overall contact angle,

% \begin{equation}
%   \Delta E_\mathrm{{total} } = E_\mathrm{k} + \Delta E_\mathrm{\gamma_{ew}} - E_\mathrm{d}.
%   \label{all energy equation}
% \end{equation}


To elucidate the energy evolution across the two regimes, we consider the total energy of the droplet and substrate system. The relevant energetic contributions are the kinetic energy $E_k$, the interfacial (capillary) energy $E_\gamma$, the electrostatic energy stored in the dielectric $E_e$, the gravitational potential $E_g$ (which may be negligible in the small-Bond-number limit), and the viscous dissipation $E_d$. The integrated energy balance between an initial time $0$ and time $t$ reads

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\big( E_k + E_g + E_\gamma + E_e \big) = - E_d + W_{\rm ext}.
  \label{eq:energy_general}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(W_{\rm ext}\) denotes any external mechanical work (zero in the absence of external forcing). The electrostatic energy stored in the dielectric under the contact patch (parallel-plate approximation) is

\begin{equation}
  E_e(t)=\tfrac{1}{2}C(t)\,\phi^2
  = \tfrac{1}{2}\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_r A_{\rm SL}(t)}{d}\,\phi^2,
  \label{eq:Eelec}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi$ denotes the applied potential (constant-voltage case), $d$ the dielectric thickness, and $A_{\rm SL}(t)$ the instantaneous solid-liquid contact area.

It is often convenient to express the interfacial energy using Young's relation. Taking $\gamma_{\rm SG} A_{\rm S}$ as an arbitrary reference (constant) contribution and using
$\gamma_{\rm LG}\cos\theta_{\rm s}=\gamma_{\rm SG}-\gamma_{\rm SL}$, the change in capillary energy relative to the reference can be written

\begin{equation}
  \Delta E_\gamma = \gamma_{\rm LG}\big( A_{\rm LG} - A_{\rm SL}\cos\theta_{\rm s}\big).
  \label{eq:DeltaEgamma}
\end{equation}

\noindent Under electrowetting \ref{Young-Lippmann equation} limit, if we compute the capillary energy using the voltage-dependent contact angle $\theta_{\rm ew}$,

\begin{equation}
  E_\gamma^{\rm (ew)} = \gamma_{\rm LG}\big( A_{\rm LG} - A_{\rm SL}\cos\theta_{\rm ew}\big),
\end{equation}

\noindent then substituting (\ref{Young-Lippmann equation}) yields the identity
\begin{equation}
  E_\gamma^{\rm (ew)}(t) = \Delta E_\gamma(t) - \underbrace{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_r A_{\rm SL}(t)\phi^2}{2d}}_{E_e(t)}.
  \label{eq:egamma_ew_relation}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation~\eqref{eq:egamma_ew_relation} demonstrates why we reduces the electrical term to the capillary energy. Therefore, we write the global balance in the commonly used case with no external mechanical work, the energy budget reduces to:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\big( E_k + E_g + E_\gamma^{\rm (ew)}\big) = -E_d.
  \label{eq:global energy}
\end{equation}

 \label{fig:energy}
 \end{figure}

 Figure \ref{fig:energy} delineates the temporal evolution of the energy budget for two regimes: partial rebound (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy}$a$) and deposition (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy}$b$). The dynamics are predominantly governed by the interplay and conversion between kinetic energy ($E_k$), surface energy ($E_\gamma$), and viscous dissipation ($E_d$). In the case of partial rebound (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy}$a$), the initial kinetic energy is rapidly depleted during the early spreading stage ($t^* < 0.4$), being primarily converted into surface energy to create a new liquid-gas interface and into energy dissipated through viscous effects. The surface energy peaks concomitantly with the maximum spreading diameter. Crucially, during the subsequent receding phase ($1.5 < t^* < 3.5$), a significant part of the stored surface energy is converted back into kinetic energy, driving the recoil of the lamella and the uplift of the central dome. However, the viscous dissipation $E_d$ grows monotonically. This energy loss ultimately inhibits full recoil, leaving the droplet in a partially rebounded equilibrium state. The final morphology is thus a direct consequence of the balance between the recoverable surface energy and the energy lost to dissipation.

 Conversely, the energy history for the deposition case (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy}$b$) reveals a distinctly different pathway. While the initial conversion from kinetic to surface energy is similar, the key distinction lies in the retraction stage. Here, the dissipation rate is significantly higher, as evidenced by the steeper slope of $E_d$, often due to stronger interactions within fluid. This heightened dissipation effectively arrests the retraction stage. The energy available for recoil is insufficient to overcome the combined effects of surface adhesion. The surface energy keeps at a relatively high value with a significant reconversion into kinetic energy. Therefore, the droplet will oscillate up and down repeatedly on the ground until all its kinetic energy is exhausted, and settles into a stable, pancake-like deposited state. The energy budget demonstrates that deposition arises once viscous dissipation exhausts the droplet's kinetic energy and prevents the release of surface energy, effectively arresting the interface in a minimum surface energystate.


 The state of Complete rebound is noticed to exist widely in the range of $We$ number less than $5$. The bouncing mechanism is predicated on the persistence of an air film sustained at low impact velocities. This sub-micrometre air cushion dissipates kinetic energy and reverses the momentum of droplets. Consequently, the interposition of the air film prevents direct contact between the droplet and substrate during low-velocity impact; thereby eliminating wettability-dependent effects. As this mechanism has been extensively documented in prior studies, it is not the primary focus of the present analysis.



\subsection{Influence of Electric Potential Decay on Droplet Behavior}

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/decay.pdf}}
  \caption{Radial variation of the substrate contact angle, $\theta_{\rm ew}$, induced by electrowetting. The parameter $\alpha$ denotes different electric potential decay coefficients, from $1$ to $5$.}
 \label{fig:decay}
 \end{figure}

 Incorporating a voltage decay coefficient into this model induces profound alterations in droplet dynamics. Modifying the $\alpha$-parameter in Equation~\ref{dynamic electric potential} drastically perturbs the interfacial voltage distribution. Consequently, the formerly uniform solid-liquid contact angle is supplanted by a conical distribution-minimised centrally and maximised peripherally-owing to voltage decay. Figure \ref{fig:decay} illustrates the variation of the contact angle in the radial direction under electrowetting conditions for different decay coefficients $\alpha$. This funnel-like contact angle profile enables the droplet to achieve a reduced contact angle upon initial substrate contact. As the droplet spreads, the contact angle progressively increases. Compared to uniform electrowetting surfaces, this configuration promotes enhanced droplet retraction and rebound.

 Figure \ref{fig:dropR} presents the temporal evolution of the droplet spreading radius under various decay coefficients of electric potential, ranging from 0.01 to 5. Interrupted curves indicate the occurrence of partial rebound, where the droplet detaches and emits secondary droplets. It can be observed that for the decay coefficients of electric potential below 0.5, the droplet maintains a deposition state. However, as the decay coefficients of electric potential increases, the maximum spreading radius diminishes, and the droplet exhibits a heightened tendency towards partial rebound. As $\alpha$ approaches infinity, the droplet spreading behaviour converges towards that of impact onto a surface with a static $90^\circ$ contact angle. Conversely, as $\alpha$ tends to zero, the spreading behaviour increasingly resembles the case of droplet impact under full electrowetting activation with a uniform contact angle $\theta_{\rm ew}$.


 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/dropR.pdf}}
  \caption{Temporal evolution of the normalized droplet spreading diameter versus normalized time for electric potential decay coefficients $\alpha$ ranging from 0.010 to 4.605.}
 \label{fig:dropR}
 \end{figure}

 Subsequently, the energy evolution corresponding to 9 distinct values of the electrical dissipation coefficient $\alpha$ is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:ETC}. It is observed that as $\alpha$ increases, the energy distribution shifts from a low-dissipation regime, in which kinetic energy is fully dissipated, to a high-dissipation regime, where kinetic and surface energies undergo mutual conversion. Moreover, at the same final time, the proportion of surface energy increases with $\alpha$. This trend is attributed to droplet partial rebound during retraction, which leads to the ejection of satellite droplets and a consequent significant increase in total surface area. Simultaneously, gravitational potential energy increases during retraction, ultimately converting into kinetic energy that facilitates partial rebound and detachment from the substrate. This behaviour contrasts with the deposition observed for lower $\alpha$ values (first row of the figure~\ref{fig:ETC}), wherein the droplet undergoes damped oscillations characterised by cyclic exchanges between gravitational potential and surface energy until the kinetic energy is fully dissipated.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{fig/dropETC.pdf}}
  \caption{Temporal evolution of energy conversion during droplet impact on the substrate. From left to right, the panels correspond to increasing values of the electric potential decay coefficients $\alpha$ (from $0.010$ to $4.605$), identical to those in Figure~\ref{fig:dropR}. The abscissa indicates the dimensionless time, and the ordinate shows the partition among kinetic, surface, gravitational energies and dissipation.}
 \label{fig:ETC}
 \end{figure}

To better characterise the evolution of kinetic energy, Figure~\ref{fig:EK} presents the kinetic energy as a function of time. The electrical dissipation coefficient $\alpha$ is shown to directly influence the kinetic energy profile. The kinetic energy reaches its minimum when the droplet attains its maximum spreading radius, at which point the kinetic energy is fully converted into surface energy, in line with the peak of the spreading radius curve. Subsequently, during rapid retraction, surface energy is converted back into kinetic energy, yielding the first peak in kinetic energy.

It is evident that increasing $\alpha$ markedly advances the time at which this first kinetic energy peak occurs. This is because the retraction phase is dominated by regions of high effective contact angle (approaching the $90^\circ$ retraction behaviour), which generally promotes higher kinetic energy recovery. In the later stages of retraction, the reduction in contact angle has limited influence on kinetic energy (serving mainly to delay the second kinetic energy peak during rebound), meaning that higher values of $\alpha$ typically result in greater kinetic energy available for rebound.

At low $\alpha$, the droplet cannot overcome the wetting influence of the substrate in the mid to late stages of retraction. The droplet undergoes oscillations during which kinetic energy is progressively dissipated, ultimately leading to deposition. In contrast, at high $\alpha$, the first kinetic energy peak attained during retraction is sufficiently large to overcome substrate adhesion, resulting in partial rebound.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/dropEK.pdf}}
  \caption{Evolution of the kinetic energy fraction with dimensionless time for different electric potential dissipation coefficients $\alpha$ during the process of droplet impact on the substrate. The horizontal axis represents dimensionless time, and the vertical axis represents the distribution of the kinetic energies.}
 \label{fig:EK}
 \end{figure}

 Through temporal integration of the energy energy over time on the wetted surface, the electrical work expenditure $W_{\rm ew}$ effectively acting on the wetting behaviour of the substrate is obtained, shown in figure~\ref{fig:EW}. This smoothed profile serves as a measure of the fraction of electrical energy actually consumed in altering the contact angle. It is shown that for lower values of the electrical dissipation coefficient $\alpha$, a greater proportion of electrical energy is directly utilised to modify the contact angle during droplet spreading. This arises because the evolution of wetting energy does not follow a simple linear trend, but rather evolves through three distinct phases, owing to the funnel-like distribution of the substrate contact angle during both spreading and retraction. Furthermore, this component of energy increases most rapidly during the spreading stage, then enters a plateau region in the early retraction phase, and continues to increase at a reduced rate in the later retraction stage. Only once the droplet has stabilised on the substrate does $W_{\rm ew}$ attain a steady value.

  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/dropEW.pdf}}
  \caption{Evolution of electrical work expenditure $W_{\rm ew}$ effectively acting on the wetting of the substrate with dimensionless time for different electric potential dissipation coefficients $\alpha$ during the process of droplet impact on the substrate.

 \end{figure}

 A particularly intriguing outcome arises when electrode geometry and placement are tailored to exploit potential dissipation, thereby enabling precise control of droplet morphology. At $We=100$ and an applied potential of $350\,\mathrm{V}$, dissipation-driven modulation permits the formation of a ring-shaped droplet with remarkable ease--an outcome otherwise difficult to achieve by merely altering substrate chemistry. This effect relies on a highly resistive annular electrode positioned at the droplet diameter, where the potential field is prescribed as

\begin{equation}
  \phi(r,t) = \phi_0 \cos(2\pi f t) \cdot \mathrm{e}^{- \alpha (r-r_0)^n}.
  \label{eq:ring dissipation}
\end{equation}

 \noindent In this formulation, $\alpha \gg 1$ quantifies the coefficient of electric potential decay, $n=30$ controls the width of the annular field, and $r_0 = D_0$ fixes its radial location. As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ring_theta}, the corresponding distribution of contact angle along the radial direction mimics a square-wave profile, yet remains governed by the electric potential decay functional form. Such electrode-enabled control offers a powerful and effective strategy for manipulating droplet dynamics beyond conventional surface treatments.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/ring_theta.pdf}}
  \caption{Radial variation of the electrowetting-induced substrate contact angle $\theta_{\rm ew}$ for an annular electrode with the coefficient of electric potential decay taken into account.}
 \label{fig:ring_theta}
 \end{figure}

 As for the formation of the annular droplet, the mechanism is similar to that induced by a wettability discontinuity. The droplet first undergoes complete spreading and wetting. Subsequent retraction towards the centre generates intense capillary waves, which converge at the droplet's axis. These waves induce pronounced vertical oscillations on the upper surface of the droplet. As the amplitude of these oscillations increases, the rising liquid interface interacts with an entrapped gas cavity, ultimately triggering the formation of a central through-hole. The droplet then retracts radially outward from this hole, eventually stabilising into a toroidal structure. A detailed dynamical description and energy analysis of this process has been provided in our previous publication and is therefore not repeated here.

\subsection{Frequency-Dependent Response of Electrowetting-Induced Motion}

 The frequency of electrowetting significantly influences the wetting radius and oscillation amplitude of a sessile droplet. A sessile droplet subjected to an alternating electrowetting signal exhibits vertical oscillations. However, the manner in which frequency variation affects droplet spreading and retraction during impact remains an open question. To investigate this, we varied the driving frequency $f$ from 25 to 8000 Hz. This frequency sweep induces a cyclic variation of the contact angle at the wall, which decreases from $90^\circ$ to a minimum value (approximately $60^\circ$) and then returns to $90^\circ$, following a cosine functional form. Such variation in contact angle alters the force balance associated with wetting dynamics throughout the droplet's motion. Figure~\ref{fig:freq} illustrates the temporal evolution of the contact angle at the substrate for different driving frequencies.

 \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/Freq.pdf}}
  \caption{Comparison of drop spreading radius during impact process obtained from simulations at $We=20$.}
 \label{fig:freq}
 \end{figure}

 At the moment the droplet is released, the voltage is activated on the substrate, inducing a time-dependent contact angle variation governed by the Young-Lippmann equation. Since the contact angle remains consistently below $90^\circ$, no thin air film forms between the droplet and the substrate upon contact. Consequently, the spreading and retraction dynamics are entirely governed by the evolving substrate contact angle. The Weber number of the droplet impact was fixed at 35 and the voltage amplitude at 180 V to ensure that the droplet's motion remained within the deposition regime. Throughout the deposition process, the droplet initially impacts the substrate, then gradually equilibrates under the combined influence of inertial and capillary forces, and ultimately stabilises on the surface. Even with increasing voltage frequency, the droplet continues to exhibit the characteristic dynamic stages of spreading, retraction, and rebounding during the process of deposition.
